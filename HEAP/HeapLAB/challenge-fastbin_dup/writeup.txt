We cant use 0x7f fastbins

So we can use one fastbin dup to set up a fake size field in the main arena

pwndbg> p/x av->system_mem
pwndbg> dq av->top

We were dealing with the top chunk size integrity check, wich waw comparing our fake top chunk size

-s parameter in system("bin/sh") avoid malformed characterd
-p does not reset uid and still root
